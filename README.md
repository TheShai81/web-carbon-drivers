# The True Drivers of Web Carbon Footprints
## A Data-Driven Study of Page Size, JavaScript, Cacheability, and Client-Side Processing

### Description:

This was a study that aimed taking a more holistic approach at analyzing performance audits, network logs, and modeled emission estimates of widely-visited websites to empirically examine the per-page energy use and carbon emissions of web pages. Code involved in the analysis as well as the final report are included in this repository.
